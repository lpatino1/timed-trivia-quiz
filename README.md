# timed-trivia-quiz

## Description

I created a character fan quiz for a gacha game called Genshin Impact. It is a work in progress. Currently, only the first quiz works. You will click on the orange-haired character to start the quiz. You will have 100 seconds to answer 4 questions. If you answer incorrectly, 20 seconds will be taken from your timer. You will have the option to save your initials and score at the end.
